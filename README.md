# README - ECE140A Lab 5

## Introduction

In lab 5, we will use components and concepts from previous labs (with a few
more additional components) to make our JetBots participate in a relay race
autonomously. The lab will be divided into five stages:

0. Setup. Getting the lab 5 code on your JetBots.
1. Pre-processing. The participants perform calibration.
2. Discovery. The participants discover each other.
3. Consensus. The participants will decide where each of them should start the
   race.
4. Race. Self-explantory.
5. Post-processing. The participants aggregate the information obtained during
   the race to generate a "map" of the tracks.
